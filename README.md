I created my frontend using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I chose this because Nextjs is built on react framework and it provides a lot of structures for security and modularity.

## Getting Started

Firstly, run:

```bash
yarn install
```
then build project with
```bash
yarn build
```
then start the server with
```bash
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
